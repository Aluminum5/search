Ahmia is the search engine for `.onion` domains on the Tor anonymity
network. It is led by [Juha Nurmi](//github.com/juhanurmi) and is based
in Finland.

### Development warning

Ahmia is currently under active development and may require a different
stack shortly. **These directions may become outdated. Please check with
Juha if they are still accurate if you have problems.**


### Compatibility

The newest version of Ahmia is built with Python 2.7, Django and
Elasticsearch. You will need to know these technologies to create a
working Ahmia installation. Ahmia crawls using OnionBot.


### Support

No support is currently provided. It is up to you for now. This will
change as Ahmia stabilizes.
